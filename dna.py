    The task of your function is to find two particular kinds of errors:
    Unmatched nucleotides, in which one strand contains a dash ('-') at a given index, or does not contain a nucleotide at the given index 
    (if the strings are not the same length). Each of these counts as 1 error.
    Permutations, in which a letter from one strand is matched against the wrong letter in the other strand. 
    
    For example, A might accidentally pair with C, or G might pair with G. Each of these counts as 2 errors.
    
    For example, consider these two DNA strands:
    "GGGA-GAATCTCTGGACT" 
    "CTCTACTTA-AGACCGGTACAGG"
    This pair of strands has three permutations (at indexes 1, 15, and 17), 
    and seven unmatched nucleotides (dashes at indexes 4 and 9, and nucleotides in the second string with no match at indexes 18-22). 
    The permutations count as a total of 3 * 2 = 6 errors, and the unmatched nucleotides count as 7 * 1 = 7 errors, so your function
    would return an error count of 6+7 = 13 total errors if passed the two above strands.
    
    You may assume that each string consists purely of the characters A, C, T, G, and â€“ (the dash character), 
    but the letters could appear in either upper or lowercase. 
    The strings might be the same length, or the first or second might be longer than the other. 
    Either string could be very long, very short, or even the empty string.
